# Custom Form Builder Project

This is a MERN stack project for building a custom form builder with three unique question types. The project utilizes the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Task Summary

Build a custom form builder with the following requirements:

- A user interface (UI) for a custom form editor to create and edit forms.
- The ability to save forms into the MongoDB database.
- A form with a preview/fill link where users can answer questions, and responses are saved in the backend.
- Everything should be saved into MongoDB with proper schemas.

## Task Deliverables

1. **Form Editor UI:**
   - Create a UI for a custom form editor where users can create and edit forms.
   - Include the ability to add images to questions and a header image at the top of the form.

2. **Form Preview/Fill:**
   - Implement a form preview/fill link where users can fill in the form questions.
   - Ensure that responses are saved in the MongoDB backend with proper schemas.

## Task Description

- Use BoloForms approval form builder as inspiration, but avoid copying the UI. Make your own adjustments or use other form builders like Typeform, Paperform for UI inspiration.

- Implement the ability to add images to questions (as seen in the 2nd page) and add a header image at the top of the form.

- Create three types of questions inspired by auto proctor: Categorize, Cloze, Comprehension. Be innovative and aim to build something different.
